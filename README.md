# GPD Win Max 2 Wiki/Guide
A list of things useful to owners of the GPD Win Max 2

# A check list of things to check on a new device
###### Credits to SuperSexySoapTurtle#6606 on discord.
1. Test gpu under load for black screen. (Use graphically heavy games, 3dmark, photoshop, etc.)
2. Check bios version to make sure its up to date (Only update if necessary, see #1)
3. Test all keyboard keys (A lot of people are having issues with missed inputs) If you're having issues, try putting tape under the keycap
4. Test analog deadzones and [update firmware](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2lqucxtobzk0wfc/GPD_Gamepad_Firmware_Tool%25288%2529.exe/file) if needed
5. Test for static shock (Some dude was getting shocked by his unit occasionally lmao)
6. Look for dead pixels
7. Test if micro sd & sd card can be read. A lot of users were having issues with it disconnecting and reconnecting. This problem doesn't immediately show up, so if you use  SD and Micro SD a lot, I would monitor this.
8. Touch screen deadzones. Make sure all corners of the screen can be touched correctly. (I'd recommend touching and dragging each corner on the desktop to test this)
9. Make sure touch pad isn't going insane. (If it is, install [firmware update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QlJEQPft1qemrM8F5jseteMwCc7-kVY_/view) from gpd)
10. Make sure screen is glued correctly (Some dude could see into his unit through a gap in the upper half of the screen lmao)
11. Do a full scan for malware with Microsoft defender. It should catch whatever worm or virus if any. Or just reinstall OS if you aren't lazy like me.
12. [Test analog stick circularity.](https://gamepad-tester.com/)
13. Make sure keycaps don't have cracks in them.
14. Make sure Dpad is working correctly.
15. Make sure remote play is working correctly. (A user was having issues with the screen randomly going black and having to force the machine to shut down.)
###### Extra things to check for the Win Max 2 2023 refresh.
1. Functionality of the onboard HDMI port (some units arrived with them dead).
2. If the device is able to run stably with the RAM speed at 7500MT/s.
3. Check Advanced->AMD PBS->Display Configurations, make sure all is recognized properly.
4. USB-C display out on both ports (note: hard to diagnose since USB-carried protocols are a mess)
5. Display having no retention, flickering or being halved.
6. M.2 2230 SSD and slot not being dead.
7. Keyboard not being squeaky or otherwise weird.
8. Cooling fan may not be plugged in (happened on one unit).
9. SD slots working as intended individually (note: they are not working simultaneously by design).
10. Paint not flaking on gamepad covers.
11. Properly seated/fixed/installed shoulder controls
12. Temps should be also checked, might need repasting

###### Credits to miracy#7746 on Discord for the instructions.
###### 1. Download the file above and put the contents of the ZIP file in the root directory of a FAT32 USB (so that the startup.nsh file is in the root of the USB). You can leave this plugged in.
###### 2. In Windows, if you are using Bitlocker, open the start menu, type in bitlocker, open that control panel, and select the option to suspend Bitlocker. IF YOU USE BITLOCKER MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RECOVERY KEY AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE.
###### 3. Shut the computer down. Turn it back on and press delete at the beginning of the boot sequence to open the UEFI (you can spam it).
###### 4. In UEFI, you need to disable Secure Boot. If advanced is turned on, this is several tabs over, I think under Advanced, and you'll see Secure Boot as an option in one of the tabs - hit that and then choose disable.
###### 5. Then go to the boot tab and make sure that the first device in the boot order is the USB (or however you want to boot from the USB, boot from the USB now)
###### 6. You'll get text on the screen (if you did not do 4, you will get a red window saying that the signature was invalid). and then you press any key to continue. It will take several minutes to install the UEFI. This installer just suddenly makes the computer turn off without warning, after all the steps are done (the last screen has several bar meters that fill up).
###### 7. At this point, unplug the USB drive. I had to turn the computer on manually again. It takes some extra time for the boot logo to come up - just be patient. Use delete to enter UEFI again and undo steps 4-5 as needed (turn secure boot back on and change the primary boot drive back to the NVME).
###### 8. When you get back to Windows, you should not need to undo 2. Or at least Bitlocker had turned itself back on by this time.

# Useful information
1. For chargers, it MUST support AT LEAST PD3.0 15v 3A to trickle charge, but the OS might force your TDP down when plugged in to a charger like that to try to ensure the battery gets charged, a charger that support 20v is heavily recommanded for use while the device is under load(eg. gaming while plugged in), 20v 3A is good enough to play games and charge at the same time, but with a 20v 5A charger and e-marked cable it will be faster if the TDP is high and you are loading the device heavily.
2. All WM2 comes with the same PD 20v 5A charger with a 1 meter cable in box, the charger uses the Chinese/US two prong plug and comes with an adapter for your region if your plug is different.
3a. The included charger have been tested to be safe for both you and the device, the switching frequency is around 100kHz and a quick power analysis have been done to test the voltage ripple under full 20v 5A load with the results coming out at around 110mVp-p(0.55% of output) at 20MHz BW limit(This results only applies to the stock charger that came with the original Win Max 2 2022, although the one that comes with the 2023 model might be very similar or the same electrically).<br/>

3b. Secondary voltage referenced to mains earth(This results only applies to the stock charger that came with the original Win Max 2 2022, although the one that comes with the 2023 model might be very similar or the same electrically).<br/>

3c. Included charger under full 100w load, note the voltage drop is due to the cable used in the test and due to using a two point measurement instead of a four point measurement, the voltage drop is the same for other power supplies when running the same two point measurement(This results only applies to the stock charger that came with the original Win Max 2 2022, although the one that comes with the 2023 model might be very similar or the same electrically).<br/>

# Known issues
1. Some specific charger would cause the WM2 to lower its TDP when plugged in.
2. On some units the SD card slots will constantly disconnet and reconnect rendering it unuseable.(This only happens to WM2 2022)(See below for workaround)
3. Display out on hubs plugged into the USB 3.2 slot doesn't work and lock the resolution to 800x600
4. Some spacebars doesn't trigger consistently. (See below for fix)
5. Some units have erratic touchpads and registers random touches.(See below for potential fix)
6. Some Bitrates and Sample Rates for the built-in DAC are sometimes missing on windows.(See below for fix)
7. Sometimes the trackpad might stop working and the firmware update tool fails to recognize the device.(See below for potential fix)
###### Known WM2 2023 specific issues
1. The 780M iGPU is falsely reported as 760M with the drivers from the inital launch from AMD.
2. Some HDMI ports are DOA.
3. Some units cannot run stably with RAM speed at 7500MT/s

# Workarounds
###### SD card slots disconneting constantly workaround, credits to ciphray#8122 on discord for the workaround, credits to Xryptic#5251 on discord for the instructions.<br/>
For anyone having SD/MicroSD disconnect/reconnect issues, the wonderful Ciphray has found a temporary solution that will work until GPD comes up with a fix. It lowers your SD readers speeds to USB 2.0 speeds, but they will stop having problems.<br/>
